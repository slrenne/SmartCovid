Datasets and code for the study

## This study
Transition to digital pathology (DP) usually takes months or years to be completed. We were familiarizing with DP solutions, when COVID19 epidemic forced us to embark in an abrupt transition. We aim to describe quantitatively how the abrupt transition to DP might affect the quality of diagnosis, to model the possible causes via probabilistic modeling and to gauge qualitatively the perception of this abrupt transition.
