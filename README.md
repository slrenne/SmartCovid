## This study
Transition to digital pathology (DP) usually takes months or years to be completed. We were familiarizing with DP solutions, when COVID19 epidemic forced us to embark in an abrupt transition. We aim to describe quantitatively how the abrupt transition to DP might affect the quality of diagnosis, to model the possible causes via probabilistic modeling and to gauge qualitatively the perception of this abrupt transition. 

## This repository
 This repository contains the datasets used for the analysis and commented custom code to reproduce the results (figures and tables), describing the models, the prior predictive simulations, the script for the analysis the posterior predictive simulations.
